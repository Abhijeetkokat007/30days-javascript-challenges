// Day 2: Operators
// Tasks/Activities:
// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a = 10 ;
let b = 50 ;
let sum = a + b ;
console.log("The Addition of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + sum);

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.5

let subtract = a - b ;
console.log("The subtract of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + subtract);

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let multiplication = a * b ;
console.log("The multiplication of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + multiplication);


// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let division = a / b ;
console.log("The division of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + division);

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let remainder = 27 % 5 ;
console.log("The remainder of " + 27 + " and " + 5 + " is: " + remainder);
// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let num = 27 ;
let newvalue = 20 ;
num += newvalue
console.log("The  new value of num after adding " + newvalue + " is: " + num)

// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let num1 = 27 ;
let newvalue1 = 20 ;
num1 -= newvalue1
console.log("The  new value of num after subtraction " + newvalue1 + " is: " + num1)

// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
let num2 = 15;


console.log(" (num2 >18) result :  " + (num2 >18))
console.log(" (num2 <18) result :  " + (num2 <18) )

// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

console.log(" (num2 >=18) result :" + (num2 >= 18))
console.log(" (num2 <=18) result :" + (num2 <= 18))
// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using  == and == and log the result to the console.
let num3 = '15' ;
console.log(" (num2 == num3) result :" + (num2 == num3))
console.log(" (num2 === num3) result :" + (num2 === num3))

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let result = (num2 >=10) && (num2 <= 10)
console.log("(num2 >=10) && (num2 <= 10) result : " + result)
//  Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
 result = (num2 >=10) || (num2 <= 10)
console.log("(num2 >=10) || (num2 <= 10) result : " + result)

// Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
console.log(" (!num2 <= 10) result : " + (!num2 <= 10))
// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

result = (num2 > 10) ? "Positive" : "Negative"
console.log(" ternary operator result : " +result); //#output Positive
